# Another Todo List
This is just meant to be a simple todo list app to keep me in practice and potentially get a useful tool out of. The inevitable feature creep will also be a good opportunity to learn some new things.

### Packaging with Electron
The application can be run using the '_start-electron.bat' file for development purposes. Otherwise, '_npm-build.bat' will create a build of the app under a new folder. The '_winstaller.bat' batch file is inteded to be ran after a build is created in order to create an installer. Currently, I only intend to develop this for use with Windows since that's all I'll use it for.
